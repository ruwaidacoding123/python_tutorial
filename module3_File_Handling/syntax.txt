#Syntax in python
'''
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. 
Errors are the problems in a program due to which 
the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions 
are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.

'''
#Difference between Syntax Error and Exceptions

'''
Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by
 the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program.
'''

'''
Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is 
syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error. 
This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, 
it changes the normal flow of the program.

#Example:

# initialize the amount variable
marks = 10000

# perform division with 0
a = marks / 0
print(a)

# Output:
# Traceback (most recent call last) :
# File “/home/f3ad05420ab851d4bd106ffb04229907.py”, line 4, in
a=marks/0
# ZeroDivisionError : #division by zero
